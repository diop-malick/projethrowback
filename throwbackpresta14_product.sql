The Air Jordan I was the first shoe to be worn in the NBA with multiple colors. Soon after the release, the NBA banned the most popular shoe of the decade to be worn by MJ. Every time Michael stepped on the court with a pair he would have to pay a couple thousand<br />dollars. Nike loved this idea so much that they encouraged MJ to wear the shoes, and Nike would<br />pay the fees. In result, Nike gave the Air Jordan 1 “The shoe banned by the NBA” label. There was <br />23 different color variations released. <br />In 1994, Nike re-released the Air Jordan 1, but they sold terribly. Since 2001, the Air Jordan I is regularly re-released in several colorways. In 2004, the Air Jordan 1 Low appeared, followed in 2008 by the Low Phat.</p>','<p>Year of release: 2012</p>','air-jordan-i-ko-white-black-varsity-red','Nike Air Jordan I KO White/Black/Varsity Red AJ 1 2012',NULL,'Air Jordan I KO White/Black/Varsity Red','Air Jordan I KO White/Black/Varsity Red',NULL,NULL),(44,1,2,'<p>Année de sortie: 2012</p>\r\n<p>Le modèle AJKO original a vu le jour en 1985, année de la sortie de la Air Jordan I.

La Air Jordan I a été la première basket multicolore à être portée en NBA, ce qui a entraîné son interdiction par la ligue. Si bien que, à chaque match où Jordan la portait, la NBA lui adressait une amende de plusieurs milliers de dollars. Nike a sauté sur cette occasion pour promouvoir la Air Jordan 1 et a décidé de payer les amendes infligées à MJ. Ainsi, la paire a été surnommée “la paire interdite en NBA“. La Air Jordan est sortie dans 23 coloris. <br />En 1994, Nike a réédité le modèle mais il n’a pas eu le succès commercial escompté.

The Nike Dunk has a lower profile outer sole than its parent shoes. The intent was a lighter weight and staying closer to the ground. The Dunk was used to spearhead what Nike called the « College Colors » program. They signed some college basketball teams to an exclusive Dunk sponsorship deal; in simple terms, the deal meant that each colored pair of Dunks matched their uniforms. <br />Since its reintroduction in 1998, the Dunk has transformed from a basic basketball shoe into a subcultural icon and an inspiration for fashion, culture, and art.  Special collaborations and regional releases have made the Dunk stronger than ever.

La Dunk a été utilisée comme fer de lance de ce que Nike a appelé le programme « Collège Colors ». Nike a créé un accord exclusif de parrainage avec certaines équipes de basket-ball universitaires américaines; dans des termes simples, l\'accord était que la couleur de la Dunk corresponde à la couleur de l’uniforme de l’équipe universitaire. Depuis sa réintroduction en 1998, la Dunk a changé de statut et est devenue une icône culturelle, une source d\'inspiration pour la mode et l\'art.

The Air Jordan I was the first shoe to be worn in the NBA with multiple colors. Soon after the release, the NBA banned the most popular shoe of the decade to be worn by MJ. Every time Michael stepped on the court with a pair he would have to pay a couple thousand<br />dollars.

The Nike Dunk has a lower profile outer sole than its parent shoes. The intent was a lighter weight and staying closer to the ground. The Dunk was used to spearhead what Nike called the « College Colors » program. They signed some college basketball teams to an exclusive Dunk sponsorship deal; in simple terms, the deal meant that each colored pair of Dunks matched their uniforms. <br />Since its reintroduction in 1998, the Dunk has transformed from a basic basketball shoe into a subcultural icon and an inspiration for fashion, culture, and art.  Special collaborations and regional releases have made the Dunk stronger than ever.

Le profil de la semelle extérieure est plus abaissé que pour les précédentes versions. Le but était d’obtenir plus de légèreté et de rester plus près du sol. La Dunk a été utilisée comme fer de lance de ce que Nike a appelé le programme « Collège Colors ». Nike a créé un accord exclusif de parrainage avec certaines équipes de basket-ball universitaires américaines; dans des termes simples, l\'accord était que la couleur de la Dunk corresponde à la couleur de l’uniforme de l’équipe universitaire. Depuis sa réintroduction en 1998, la Dunk a changé de statut et est devenue une icône culturelle, une source d\'inspiration pour la mode et l\'art. À cela s’ajoute de nombreuses collaborations et des lancements spécifiques aux différents marchés mondiaux.

The Nike Dunk has a lower profile outer sole than its parent shoes. The intent was a lighter weight and staying closer to the ground. The Dunk was used to spearhead what Nike called the « College Colors » program. They signed some college basketball teams to an exclusive Dunk sponsorship deal; in simple terms, the deal meant that each colored pair of Dunks matched their uniforms. <br />Since its reintroduction in 1998, the Dunk has transformed from a basic basketball shoe into a subcultural icon and an inspiration for fashion, culture, and art.  Special collaborations and regional releases have made the Dunk stronger than ever. In 2004, Nike released the first Dunk mid.</p>','<p>Year of release: 2012</p>','dunk-sb-low-nontourage-qs','Nike Dunk SB Low Nontourage QS 2012 quickstrike limited skateboard entourage',NULL,'Dunk SB Low Nontourage QS','Dunk SB Low Nontourage QS',NULL,NULL),(319,1,2,'<p>A propos de la Dunk:</p>\r\n<p>Année de sortie du modèle original: 1985</p>\r\n<p>La Dunk a été lancée par Nike en 1985 dans sa version montante et basse. Le profil de la semelle extérieure est plus abaissé que pour les précédentes versions. Le but était d’obtenir plus de légèreté et de rester plus près du sol. La Dunk a été utilisée comme fer de lance de ce que Nike a appelé le programme « Collège Colors ». Nike a créé un accord exclusif de parrainage avec certaines équipes de basket-ball universitaires américaines; dans des termes simples, l\'accord était que la couleur de la Dunk corresponde à la couleur de l’uniforme de l’équipe universitaire. Depuis sa réintroduction en 1998, la Dunk a changé de statut et est devenue une icône culturelle, une source d\'inspiration pour la mode et l\'art. À cela s’ajoute de nombreuses collaborations et des lancements spécifiques aux différents marchés mondiaux.

Low-profile leather wrapped Phylon™ midsole with heel and forefoot Zoom Air™ units. Midfoot carbon fiber composite plate. Tinker Hatfield kept on making original designs. <br />The AJXIII featured a nice hologram on the ankle and the design was inspired by a panther (one of MJ’s nicknames). The outsole with pads like a paw and circles representing whiskers. The hologram shows a basketball; the number 23 &amp; the jumpman logo. On December 30th 1997, Jordan broke Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\'s NBA record, by scoring in double-digits for the 788th consecutive game. He also led the Bulls to their sixth NBA Championship title before retiring from the game (for the second time). We must precise that during the 1998 NBA Finals, which were his last games with the Bulls, MJ was (already) wearing the new Air Jordan XIV.</p>','<p>Year of release: 2011</p>','air-jordan-xiii-ray-allen-pe','Nike Air Jordan XIII Ray Allen PE player limited edition AJ 13 2011',NULL,'Air Jordan XIII Ray Allen PE','Air Jordan XIII Ray Allen PE',NULL,NULL),(385,1,2,'<p>A propos de la Air Jordan XIII:</p>\r\n<p>Date de sortie du modèle original: 1996</p>\r\n<p>Designer: Tinker Hatfield</p>\r\n<p>La Air Jordan XIII est composée de cuir moltoné et de parties latérales en daim ainsi que d’un système unique dissimulant le laçage. La semelle intermédiaire en Phylon ™, englobe un double système Zoom Air ™ (talon et semelle avant). La partie centrale de la semelle est faite d’une plaque en fibre de carbone composite. Tinker Hatfield continue de proposer des concepts originaux. Le design de la AJXIII s’inspire de l’un des surnoms de Jordan : « the black cat » (la panthère noire). La semelle extérieure rappelle les coussinets et les cercles représentant les moustaches de la panthère. Au niveau de la cheville figure un hologramme faisant apparaître un ballon de basket ; le numéro 23&amp; le logo Jumpman. <br />Le 30 Décembre 1997, Jordan a battu le record de Kareem Abdul-Jabbar en devenant le premier joueur NBA à marquer plus de 10 points au cours de 788 matchs consécutifs. En 1998, il a également emmené les Bulls jusqu’à leur sixième titre de champion NBA avant de prendre sa retraite sportive (pour la deuxième fois). Il faut préciser que lors de son dernier match avec les Bulls, en Finale NBA, MJ portait (déjà) la future Air Jordan XIV.</p>','<p>Année de sortie: 2011</p>','air-jordan-xiii-ray-allen-pe','Nike Air Jordan XIII Ray Allen PE player limited edition AJ 13 2011',NULL,'Air Jordan XIII Ray Allen PE','Air Jordan XIII Ray Allen PE',NULL,NULL),(385,1,3,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(385,1,4,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(385,1,5,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(386,1,1,NULL,'<p>Year of release: 2011</p>','lebron-8-low-sprite','Lebron 8 Low Sprite LB8 Nike Air Lebron James',NULL,'Lebron 8 Low Sprite','Lebron 8 Low Sprite',NULL,NULL),(386,1,2,NULL,'<p>Année de sortie: 2011</p>','lebron-8-low-sprite','Lebron 8 Low Sprite LB8 Nike Air Lebron James',NULL,'Lebron 8 Low Sprite','Lebron 8 Low Sprite',NULL,NULL),(386,1,3,NULL,NULL,'nike-air-lebron-low-8-sprite',NULL,NULL,NULL,'nike air lebron low 8 sprite',NULL,NULL),(386,1,4,NULL,NULL,'nike-air-lebron-low-8-sprite',NULL,NULL,NULL,'nike air lebron low 8 sprite',NULL,NULL),(386,1,5,NULL,NULL,'nike-air-lebron-low-8-sprite',NULL,NULL,NULL,'nike air lebron low 8 sprite',NULL,NULL),(392,1,1,NULL,'<p>Year of release: 2012</p>','reebok-question-mid-white-red','Reebok Question Mid White/Red Allen Iverson 2012',NULL,'Reebok Question Mid White/Red','Reebok Question Mid White/Red',NULL,NULL),(392,1,2,NULL,'<p>Année de sortie: 2012</p>','reebok-question-mid-white-red','Reebok Question Mid White/Red Allen Iverson 2012',NULL,'Reebok Question Mid White/Red','Reebok Question Mid White/Red',NULL,NULL),(392,1,3,NULL,NULL,'reebok-pump-court-victory-x-kicks-hawaii',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Reebok Pump Court Victory x Kicks Hawaii',NULL,NULL),(392,1,4,NULL,NULL,'reebok-pump-court-victory-x-kicks-hawaii',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Reebok Pump Court Victory x Kicks Hawaii',NULL,NULL),(392,1,5,NULL,NULL,'reebok-pump-court-victory-x-kicks-hawaii',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Reebok Pump Court Victory x Kicks Hawaii',NULL,NULL),(395,1,1,'<p>Year of release: 2007</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>About Air Max 1:</p>\r\n<p>Year of release of OG model: 1987</p>\r\n<p>Design: Tinker Hatfield</p>\r\n<p>First visible air unit system (originally developped by NASA) ever made by NIKE.  Since 1987, the Air Max has been produced in a variety of colourways and fabric combinations.

The outsole with pads like a paw and circles representing whiskers. The hologram shows a basketball; the number 23 &amp; the jumpman logo. On December 30th 1997, Jordan broke Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\'s NBA record, by scoring in double-digits for the 788th consecutive game. He also led the Bulls to their sixth NBA Championship title before retiring from the game (for the second time). We must precise that during the 1998 NBA Finals, which were his last games with the Bulls, MJ was (already) wearing the new Air Jordan XIV.</p>','<p>Year of release: 2004</p>','air-jordan-xiii-black-true-red-04','Nike Air Jordan XIII Black/True Red \'04 AJ 13 2004 Deadstock',NULL,'Air Jordan XIII Black/True Red \'04','Air Jordan XIII Black/True Red \'04',NULL,NULL),(406,1,2,'<p>Année de sortie: 2004</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>A propos de la Air Jordan XIII:</p>\r\n<p>Date de sortie du modèle original: 1996</p>\r\n<p>Designer: Tinker Hatfield</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">La Air Jordan XIII est composée de cuir moltoné et de parties latérales en daim ainsi que d’un système unique dissimulant le laçage. La semelle intermédiaire en Phylon ™, englobe un double système Zoom Air ™ (talon et semelle avant). La partie centrale de la semelle est faite d’une plaque en fibre de carbone composite. Tinker Hatfield continue de proposer des concepts originaux. Le design de la AJXIII s’inspire de l’un des surnoms de Jordan : « the black cat » (la panthère noire). La semelle extérieure rappelle les coussinets et les cercles représentant les moustaches de la panthère. Au niveau de la cheville figure un hologramme faisant apparaître un ballon de basket ; le numéro 23&amp; le logo Jumpman. <br />Le 30 Décembre 1997, Jordan a battu le record de Kareem Abdul-Jabbar en devenant le premier joueur NBA à marquer plus de 10 points au cours de 788 matchs consécutifs. En 1998, il a également emmené les Bulls jusqu’à leur sixième titre de champion NBA avant de prendre sa retraite sportive (pour la deuxième fois). Il faut préciser que lors de son dernier match avec les Bulls, en Finale NBA, MJ portait (déjà) la future Air Jordan XIV.</p>','<p>Année de sortie: 2004</p>','air-jordan-xiii-black-true-red-04','Nike Air Jordan XIII Black/True Red \'04 AJ 13 2004 Deadstock',NULL,'Air Jordan XIII Black/True Red \'04','Air Jordan XIII Black/True Red \'04',NULL,NULL),(406,1,3,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(406,1,4,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(406,1,5,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(407,1,1,'<p>Year of release: 2012</p>','<p>Year of release: 2012</p>','lebron-9-low-floridians','Lebron 9 Low Miami Floridians 2012 LB9 Lebron James',NULL,'Lebron 9 Low Floridians','Lebron 9 Low Floridians',NULL,NULL),(407,1,2,'<p>Année de sortie: 2012</p>','<p>Année de sortie: 2012</p>','lebron-9-low-floridians','Lebron 9 Low Miami Floridians 2012 LB9 Lebron James',NULL,'Lebron 9 Low Floridians','Lebron 9 Low Floridians',NULL,NULL),(407,1,3,NULL,NULL,'nike-air-lebron-9-galaxy',NULL,NULL,NULL,'nike air lebron 9 Galaxy',NULL,NULL),(407,1,4,NULL,NULL,'nike-air-lebron-9-galaxy',NULL,NULL,NULL,'nike air lebron 9 Galaxy',NULL,NULL),(407,1,5,NULL,NULL,'nike-air-lebron-9-galaxy',NULL,NULL,NULL,'nike air lebron 9 Galaxy',NULL,NULL),(408,1,1,'<p>Year of release: 2007</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>About Air Max 1:</p>\r\n<p>Year of release of OG model: 1987</p>\r\n<p>Design: Tinker Hatfield</p>\r\n<p>First visible air unit system (originally developped by NASA) ever made by NIKE.  Since 1987, the Air Max has been produced in a variety of colourways and fabric combinations.

Some weeks before its release, MJ had announced his retirement from the NBA at 30 (following the death of his father, murdered in North <br />Carolina). Therefore, this is the first shoe he did not wear in an NBA season game, but some other players did, such as Penny Hardaway, Kendall Gill or Mitch Richmond. As MJ then decided to start a new career in Baseball, Nike created a version of the model with cleats.</p>\r\n<p>The shoe uses advanced technology: dynamic-Fit inner bootie, encapsulated Air-Sole unit (forefoot), large volume Air-Sole unit (heel), polyurethane midsole and “one-pull” lacing system. Tinker Hatfield said he was inspired by Japanese design to create this model, a way for him to <br />show that MJ had become a worldwide icon. This is also shown on the soles that feature words like « freedom », « independance », « force » and « athletic » in several languages from every continent.</p>','<p>Year of release: 2012</p>','air-jordan-ix-motorboat-jones','Nike Air Jordan IX Motorboat Jones Johnny Kilroy Pack AJ 9 2012',NULL,'Air Jordan IX Motorboat Jones','Air Jordan IX Motorboat Jones',NULL,NULL),(425,1,2,'<p>A propos de la Air Jordan IX:</p>\r\n<p>Date de sortie du modèle original: 1993</p>\r\n<p>Designer: Tinker Hatfield</p>\r\n<p>La Air Jordan IX est sortie fin 1993. Quelques semaines avant sa sortie, MJ avait annoncé sa retraite à l’âge de 30 ans (après le décès de son père, assassiné en Caroline du Nord). Par conséquent, il s\'agit de la première Air Jordan qu’il n’ait pas portée lors d’un match officiel, mais d’autres joueurs, tels que Penny Hardaway, Kendall Gill ou Mitch Richmond, l’ont étrennée sur les parquets NBA. Comme MJ avait alors décidé de se lancer dans le baseball, Nike a spécialement créé une version du modèle avec des crampons. La chaussure utilise des technologies avancées: chausson interne « dynamique-Fit », double système Air-Sole intégré (un à l’avant-pied et un grand au talon), midsole en polyuréthanne et système de laçage \"one pull\". Tinker Hatfield a dit s’être inspiré du design japonais pour la conception de ce modèle, une façon pour lui de montrer que MJ était devenu une icône dans le monde entier. Ceci est également mis en avant sur les semelles qui comportent des mots comme «liberté», «indépendance», «force» et «athlétique» dans différentes langues venues des quatre coins du monde.</p>','<p>Année de sortie: 2012</p>','air-jordan-ix-motorboat-jones','Nike Air Jordan IX Motorboat Jones Johnny Kilroy Pack AJ 9 2012',NULL,'Air Jordan IX Motorboat Jones','Air Jordan IX Motorboat Jones',NULL,NULL),(425,1,3,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(425,1,4,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(425,1,5,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(429,1,1,'<p> </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Year of release: 2012</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> </p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">About Pre Montreal Racer:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Year of release of OG model: 1973</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Montreal racer is among the first running shoes released by Nike (after the Cortez).

In 1994, Jordan had already retired from the NBA (following the murder of his father during summer ’93) and had decided to start a new career in baseball with the Chicago White Sox.  This explains the presence of the 10 lines of MJ’s main achievements on the sole of the shoe. After suffering a failure in baseball, MJ decides to make his come back in the NBA in march 1995. He’s back, wearing the AJX on court, with the Bulls but without his #23  (which had been retired). His come back is a success as he helps the Bulls qualify for the Playoffs. They finally lose against Shaq’s Orlando Magic which will then be swept by the Houston Rockets in the ’95 NBA Finals.</p>','<p>Year of release: 2012</p>','air-jordan-x-stealth','Nike Air Jordan X Stealth Black/White/Grey Retro AJ 10 2012',NULL,'Air Jordan X Stealth','Air Jordan X Stealth',NULL,NULL),(466,1,2,'<p>A propos de la Air Jordan X:</p>\r\n<p>Date de sortie du modèle original: 1994</p>\r\n<p>Designer: Tinker Hatfield</p>\r\n<p>La AJ X a bien failli être la dernière de la série. En 1994, Jordan, retraité de la NBA à la suite de l’assassinat de son père, décida de tenter une carrière professionnelle dans le baseball en intégrant les Chicago White Sox. Ceci explique que la semelle du modèle porte, sur 10 lignes, le palmarès <br />de MJ. Après avoir essuyé un échec au baseball, il décide de revenir aux affaires en NBA en mars 1995. Il est donc de retour, avec les Bulls, Jordan X aux pieds, mais sans son numéro 23 (qui avait été retiré lors de sa retraite). Son retour est un succès, il aide les Bulls à se qualifier pour les <br />Playoffs. Ils perdent finalement face aux Orlando Magic de Shaquille O’Neal qui seront à leur tour balayés par les Houston Rockets en finale NBA.</p>','<p>Année de sortie: 2012</p>','air-jordan-x-stealth','Nike Air Jordan X Stealth Black/White/Grey Retro AJ 10 2012',NULL,'Air Jordan X Stealth','Air Jordan X Stealth',NULL,NULL),(466,1,3,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(466,1,4,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(466,1,5,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(467,1,1,'<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Air Jordan II \"QF\" (for Quarter Finals) is the retro version of the pair worn by Michael Jordan during NBA season 1986/87, when the Bulls reached the Quarter Finals for the first time (Eastern Conference Semi Final lost against the Detroit Pistons).

Some weeks before its release, MJ had announced his retirement from the NBA at 30 (following the death of his father, murdered in North <br />Carolina). Therefore, this is the first shoe he did not wear in an NBA season game, but some other players did, such as Penny Hardaway, Kendall Gill or Mitch Richmond. As MJ then decided to start a new career in Baseball, Nike created a version of the model with cleats.</p>\r\n<p>The shoe uses advanced technology: dynamic-Fit inner bootie, encapsulated Air-Sole unit (forefoot), large volume Air-Sole unit (heel), polyurethane midsole and “one-pull” lacing system. Tinker Hatfield said he was inspired by Japanese design to create this model, a way for him to <br />show that MJ had become a worldwide icon. This is also shown on the soles that feature words like « freedom », « independance », « force » and « athletic » in several languages from every continent.</p>','<p>Year of release: 2012</p>','air-jordan-ix-johnny-kilroy-gs','Nike Air Jordan IX Johnny Kilroy Pack GS AJ 9 2012 platinum gym red metallic',NULL,'Air Jordan IX Johnny Kilroy GS','Air Jordan IX Johnny Kilroy',NULL,NULL),(510,1,2,'<p>Année de sortie: 2012</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>A propos de la Air Jordan IX:</p>\r\n<p>Date de sortie du modèle original: 1993</p>\r\n<p>Designer: Tinker Hatfield</p>\r\n<p>La Air Jordan IX est sortie fin 1993. Quelques semaines avant sa sortie, MJ avait annoncé sa retraite à l’âge de 30 ans (après le décès de son père, assassiné en Caroline du Nord). Par conséquent, il s\'agit de la première Air Jordan qu’il n’ait pas portée lors d’un match officiel, mais d’autres joueurs, tels que Penny Hardaway, Kendall Gill ou Mitch Richmond, l’ont étrennée sur les parquets NBA. Comme MJ avait alors décidé de se lancer dans le baseball, Nike a spécialement créé une version du modèle avec des crampons. La chaussure utilise des technologies avancées: chausson interne « dynamique-Fit », double système Air-Sole intégré (un à l’avant-pied et un grand au talon), midsole en polyuréthanne et système de laçage \"one pull\". Tinker Hatfield a dit s’être inspiré du design japonais pour la conception de ce modèle, une façon pour lui de montrer que MJ était devenu une icône dans le monde entier. Ceci est également mis en avant sur les semelles qui comportent des mots comme «liberté», «indépendance», «force» et «athlétique» dans différentes langues venues des quatre coins du monde.</p>','<p>Année de sortie: 2012</p>','air-jordan-ix-johnny-kilroy-gs','Nike Air Jordan IX Johnny Kilroy Pack GS AJ 9 2012 platinum gym red metallic',NULL,'Air Jordan IX Johnny Kilroy GS','Air Jordan IX Johnny Kilroy GS',NULL,NULL),(510,1,3,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(510,1,4,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(510,1,5,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(514,1,1,'<p>Year of release: 2012</p>','<p>Year of release: 2012</p>','roshe-run-montreal-blue-red','Air Roshe Run Montreal Blue/Red Suede Leather Premium Dark Navy Sunburst 2012',NULL,'Roshe Run Montreal Blue/Red','Roshe Run Montreal Blue/Red',NULL,NULL),(514,1,2,'<p>Année de sortie: 2012</p>','<p>Année de sortie: 2012</p>','roshe-run-montreal-blue-red','Air Roshe Run Montreal Blue/Red Suede Leather Premium Dark Navy Sunburst 2012',NULL,'Roshe Run Montreal Blue/Red','Roshe Run Montreal Blue/Red',NULL,NULL),(514,1,3,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(514,1,4,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(514,1,5,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(522,1,1,'<p>Year of release: 2012</p>','<p>Year of release: 2012</p>','air-safari-nrg-qs','Air Safari NRG QS tan/beige/black-charcoal Windrunner Leather Brown premium 2012 limited edition Quickstrike',NULL,'Air Safari NRG QS','Air Safari NRG QS',NULL,NULL),(522,1,2,'<p>Année de sortie: 2012</p>','<p>Année de sortie: 2012</p>','air-safari-nrg-qs','Air Safari NRG QS tan/beige/black-charcoal Windrunner Leather Brown premium 2012 limited edition Quickstrike',NULL,'Air Safari NRG QS','Air Safari NRG QS',NULL,NULL),(522,1,3,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(522,1,4,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(522,1,5,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(523,1,1,'<p>Year of release: 2012</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>About Air Trainer 1:</p>\r\n<p>Year of release of OG Model: 1987</p>\r\n<p>Design : Tinker Hatfield</p>\r\n<p>The Air Trainer 1 is a multipurpose sneaker created by Tinker Hatfield.

The Spiz’ike, after the Dub Zero model, was the second Jordan fusion to be released. In fact, it was <br />made up of a total of 5 different Air Jordans, the Jordan III(midsole), Jordan IV(Wings), Jordan <br />V(Uppers), Jordan VI(Tongue) &amp; Jordan IX (Pull Tab). <br />The Spiz’ike already released in dozens of colorways and more are yet to come. The cement colorway, released in 2008, is after the Air Jordan IV colorway, which was also featured in Spike Lee’s movie “Do the Right Thing” where Buggin’ Out had his brand new Air Jordan’s scuffed by a pedestrian walking his bike.</p>','<p>Year of release: 2012</p>','air-jordan-spizike-toro-bravo-gym-red-gs','Nike Air Jordan Spizike Toro Bravo Gym Red GS Raging Bull AJ 2012',NULL,'Air Jordan Spizike Toro Bravo Gym Red GS','Air Jordan Spizike Toro Bravo Gym Red GS',NULL,NULL),(543,1,2,'<p>A propos de la Air Jordan Spizike:</p>\r\n<p>Date de sortie du modèle original: 2006</p>\r\n<p>La Air Jordan Spiz’ike a été créée pour rendre hommage à Spike Lee tant pour son rôle primordial <br />dans le succès planétaire des Air Jordan que pour sa collaboration avec Nike et MJ.

La Spiz’ike existe déja en de nombreux coloris qui sont parfois inspirés de Jordan emblématiques comme le modèle « Cement » qui reprend les couleurs de la Jordan IV vue dans une scène culte de « Do the Right Thing » où un passant à vélo souille la Jordan IV de Buggin’ Out.</p>','<p>Année de sortie: 2012</p>','air-jordan-spizike-gym-red-gs','Nike Air Jordan Spizike Toro Bravo Gym Red GS Raging Bull AJ 2012',NULL,'Air Jordan Spizike Toro Bravo Gym Red GS','Air Jordan Spizike Toro Bravo Gym Red GS',NULL,NULL),(543,1,3,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(543,1,4,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(543,1,5,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(544,1,1,'<p>T-shirt Throwback Sneakers (silkcreen printed)</p>\r\n<p>100% Cotton, 190gr</p>\r\n<p>Style: classic</p>\r\n<p>Measurments (in cm):</p>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\"><img src=\"http://s7v3.scene7.com/is/image/soloinvest/icon-guide-taille-tshirt\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\"> </div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">X-Small: 62/49     </div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">Small: 69/50</div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">Medium: 72/53</div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">Large: 74/56</div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">X-Large: 76/58</div>','<p>T-shirt Throwback Sneakers White</p>','t-shirt-throwback-sneakers-white','T-shirt Throwback Sneakers White logo serigraphie',NULL,'T-shirt Throwback Sneakers White','T-shirt Throwback Sneakers White',NULL,NULL),(544,1,2,'<p>T-shirt Throwback Sneakers (logo sérigraphié)</p>\r\n<p>100% Coton, 190gr</p>\r\n<p>Coupe classique</p>\r\n<p>Mesures (en cm):</p>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\"><img src=\"http://s7v3.scene7.com/is/image/soloinvest/icon-guide-taille-tshirt\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\"> </div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">X-Small: 62/49     </div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">Small: 69/50</div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">Medium: 72/53</div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">Large: 74/56</div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">X-Large: 76/58</div>','<p>T-shirt Throwback blanc</p>','t-shirt-throwback-sneakers-blanc','T-shirt Throwback Sneakers Blanc logo serigraphie',NULL,'T-shirt Throwback Sneakers Blanc','T-shirt Throwback Sneakers Blanc',NULL,NULL),(544,1,3,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(544,1,4,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(544,1,5,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(545,1,1,'<p>T-shirt Throwback Sneakers (silkcreen printed)</p>\r\n<p>100% Cotton, 190gr</p>\r\n<p>Style: classic</p>\r\n<p>Measurments (in cm):</p>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\"><img src=\"http://s7v3.scene7.com/is/image/soloinvest/icon-guide-taille-tshirt\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\"> </div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">X-Small: 62/49     </div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">Small: 69/50</div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">Medium: 72/53</div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">Large: 74/56</div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">X-Large: 76/58</div>','<p>T-shirt Throwback Sneakers Black</p>','t-shirt-throwback-sneakers-black','T-shirt Throwback Sneakers Black logo serigraphie',NULL,'T-shirt Throwback Sneakers Black','T-shirt Throwback Sneakers Black',NULL,NULL),(545,1,2,'<p>T-shirt Throwback Sneakers (logo sérigraphié)</p>\r\n<p>100% Coton, 190gr</p>\r\n<p>Coupe classique</p>\r\n<p>Mesures (en cm):</p>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\"><img src=\"http://s7v3.scene7.com/is/image/soloinvest/icon-guide-taille-tshirt\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\"> </div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">X-Small: 62/49     </div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">Small: 69/50</div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">Medium: 72/53</div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">Large: 74/56</div>\r\n<div class=\"guide-taille\">X-Large: 76/58</div>','<p>T-shirt Throwback Sneakers noir</p>','t-shirt-throwback-sneakers-noir','T-shirt Throwback Sneakers Noir logo serigraphie',NULL,'T-shirt Throwback Sneakers Noir','T-shirt Throwback Sneakers Noir',NULL,NULL),(545,1,3,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(545,1,4,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(545,1,5,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(546,1,1,'<p>Year of release: 2013</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>About Air Jordan V:</p>\r\n<p>Year of release of OG model: 1989</p>\r\n<p>Designer: Tinker Hatfield<br />Phil Jackson took over as head coach for the Bulls in the 89-90 season.

XIII:</p>\r\n<p>Year of release of OG model: 1996</p>\r\n<p>Designer: Tinker Hatfield</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Air Jordan XIII features quilted leather upper with suede trim and unique hidden lacing system. Low-profile leather wrapped Phylon™ midsole with heel and forefoot Zoom Air™ units. Midfoot carbon fiber composite plate. Tinker Hatfield kept on making original designs. <br />The AJXIII featured a nice hologram on the ankle and the design was inspired by a panther (one of MJ’s nicknames). The outsole with pads like a paw and circles representing whiskers. The hologram shows a basketball; the number 23 &amp; the jumpman logo. On December 30th 1997, Jordan broke Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\'s NBA record, by scoring in double-digits for the 788th consecutive game. He also led the Bulls to their sixth NBA Championship title before retiring from the game (for the second time). We must precise that during the 1998 NBA Finals, which were his last games with the Bulls, MJ was (already) wearing the new Air Jordan XIV.</p>','<p>Year of release: 2013</p>','air-jordan-xiii-black-true-red','Nike Air Jordan XIII Black/True Red AJ 13 2013 Retro',NULL,'Air Jordan XIII Black/True Red','Air Jordan XIII Black/True Red',NULL,NULL),(557,1,2,'<p>Année de sortie: 2013</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>A propos de la Air Jordan XIII:</p>\r\n<p>Date de sortie du modèle original: 1996</p>\r\n<p>Designer: Tinker Hatfield</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">La Air Jordan XIII est composée de cuir moltoné et de parties latérales en daim ainsi que d’un système unique dissimulant le laçage. La semelle intermédiaire en Phylon ™, englobe un double système Zoom Air ™ (talon et semelle avant). La partie centrale de la semelle est faite d’une plaque en fibre de carbone composite. Tinker Hatfield continue de proposer des concepts originaux. Le design de la AJXIII s’inspire de l’un des surnoms de Jordan : « the black cat » (la panthère noire). La semelle extérieure rappelle les coussinets et les cercles représentant les moustaches de la panthère. Au niveau de la cheville figure un hologramme faisant apparaître un ballon de basket ; le numéro 23&amp; le logo Jumpman. <br />Le 30 Décembre 1997, Jordan a battu le record de Kareem Abdul-Jabbar en devenant le premier joueur NBA à marquer plus de 10 points au cours de 788 matchs consécutifs. En 1998, il a également emmené les Bulls jusqu’à leur sixième titre de champion NBA avant de prendre sa retraite sportive (pour la deuxième fois). Il faut préciser que lors de son dernier match avec les Bulls, en Finale NBA, MJ portait (déjà) la future Air Jordan XIV.</p>','<p>Année de sortie: 2013</p>','air-jordan-xiii-black-true-red','Nike Air Jordan XIII Black/True Red AJ 13 2013 Retro',NULL,'Air Jordan XIII Black/True Red','Air Jordan XIII Black/True Red',NULL,NULL),(557,1,3,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(557,1,4,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(557,1,5,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(558,1,1,'<p>Year of release: 2013</p>\r\n<p>About Air 180:</p>\r\n<p>Year of release of OG model: 1991</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This revolutionary shoe contained fifty per cent more air than previous Air Max models.

The Nike Dunk has a lower profile outer sole than its parent shoes. The intent was a lighter weight and staying closer to the ground. The Dunk was used to spearhead what Nike called the « College Colors » program. They signed some college basketball teams to an exclusive Dunk sponsorship deal; in simple terms, the deal meant that each colored pair of Dunks matched their uniforms. <br />Since its reintroduction in 1998, the Dunk has transformed from a basic basketball shoe into a subcultural icon and an inspiration for fashion, culture, and art.  Special collaborations and regional releases have made the Dunk stronger than ever. In 2004, Nike released the first Dunk mid.</p>','<p>Year of release: 2012</p>','dunk-skinny-leopard','Nike Dunk Skinny Leopard Women Hi Black/White 2012',NULL,'Dunk Skinny Leopard','Dunk Skinny Leopard',NULL,NULL),(615,1,2,'<p>Année de sortie: 2012</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>A propos de la Dunk:</p>\r\n<p>Année de sortie du modèle original: 1985</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">La Dunk a été lancée par Nike en 1985 dans sa version montante et basse. Le profil de la semelle extérieure est plus abaissé que pour les précédentes versions. Le but était d’obtenir plus de légèreté et de rester plus près du sol. La Dunk a été utilisée comme fer de lance de ce que Nike a appelé le programme « Collège Colors ». Nike a créé un accord exclusif de parrainage avec certaines équipes de basket-ball universitaires américaines; dans des termes simples, l\'accord était que la couleur de la Dunk corresponde à la couleur de l’uniforme de l’équipe universitaire. Depuis sa réintroduction en 1998, la Dunk a changé de statut et est devenue une icône culturelle, une source d\'inspiration pour la mode et l\'art. À cela s’ajoute de nombreuses collaborations et des lancements spécifiques aux différents marchés mondiaux. En 2004, est lancée la Nike Dunk Mid.</p>\r\n<p> </p>','<p>Année de sortie: 2012</p>','dunk-skinny-leopard','Nike Dunk Skinny Leopard Women Hi Black/White 2012',NULL,'Dunk Skinny Leopard','Dunk Skinny Leopard',NULL,NULL),(615,1,3,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(615,1,4,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(615,1,5,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(616,1,1,'<p>Year of release: 2012</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>About Air Max 1:</p>\r\n<p>Year of release of OG model: 1987</p>\r\n<p>Design: Tinker Hatfield</p>\r\n<p>First visible air unit system (originally developped by NASA) ever made by NIKE.  Since 1987, the Air Max has been produced in a variety of colourways and fabric combinations.

The spoiler/heel tab was inspired by MJ\'s rare black slant-nosed or \"Flachbau\" Porsche 930 Turbo.

It has been re-released as a retro version with an unmeasurable amount of colorways and themes. The Air Max 90 was referred to as the Air Max or the Air Max III until 2000, when it was reissued. It takes its current name from its launch year, 1990. The first colourway produced was the men’s white/ black/ cool grey/ red. It was striking to say the least: the radiant red around the visible Air window exaggerated the thickness of the midsole. The upper was made of Duromesh, synthetic suede and synthetic leather.

Ce qui frappe sur ce modèle est le rouge rayonnant autour du système air  qui exagère l\'épaisseur de la semelle. La partie supérieure est faite en Duromesh, daim synthétique et cuir synthétique.

This gave the Bull\'s an extra boost and everything was flying. Jordan kept on playing his game and set a personal best when scoring 69 points in a game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Once again Hatfield came up with a revolutionary design for the new shoe.</p>\r\n<p>The AJ5 was inspired by World War II Fighter planes (Spitfire WWII) brought to light by The \"reverse flames\". The clear outsole was inspired by the clear panels of Marty MacFly\'s Back to the Future II boots which Tinker had designed for the movie. Tinker put a reflective 3M tongue with Jumpman embroidery. Whenever a photograph flash goes off, the tongue would light up and the tiny Jumpman would be highlighted in the background.</p>','<p>Year of release: 2013</p>','air-jordan-v-3lab5','Nike Air Jordan V \"3LAB5\" AJ 5 2013 QS Elephant print grey',NULL,'Air Jordan V \"3LAB5\"','Air Jordan V \"3LAB5\"',NULL,NULL),(685,1,2,'<p>Année de sortie: 2013</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>A propos de la Air Jordan V:</p>\r\n<p>Date de sortie du modèle original: 1989</p>\r\n<p>Designer: Tinker Hatfield</p>\r\n<p>Phil Jackson arrive à la tête des Bulls en 1989-90.

Tinker Hatfield puise cette fois son inspiration dans un avion de combat (le Spitfire WWII ), laissant apparaître des flammes inversées sur le côté de la chaussure. La semelle transparente a été inspirée par la paire de chaussure révolutionnaire (dessinée par Tinker hatfield) portée par Michael J Fox dans le film Retour vers le Futur II.

In 1994, Jordan had already retired from the NBA (following the murder of his father during summer ’93) and had decided to start a new career in baseball with the Chicago White Sox.  This explains the presence of the 10 lines of MJ’s main achievements on the sole of the shoe.

It takes its current name from its launch year, 1990. The first colourway produced was the men’s white/ black/ cool grey/ red. It was striking to say the least: the radiant red around the visible Air window exaggerated the thickness of the midsole. The upper was made of Duromesh, synthetic suede and synthetic leather.

The Air Jordan I was the first shoe to be worn in the NBA with multiple colors. Soon after the release, the NBA banned the most popular shoe of the decade to be worn by MJ. Every time Michael stepped on the court with a pair he would have to pay a couple thousand<br />dollars. Nike loved this idea so much that they encouraged MJ to wear the shoes, and Nike would<br />pay the fees. In result, Nike gave the Air Jordan 1 “The shoe banned by the NBA” label. There was <br />23 different color variations released. <br />In 1994, Nike re-released the Air Jordan 1, but they sold terribly. Since 2001, the Air Jordan I is regularly re-released in several colorways. In 2004, the Air Jordan 1 Low appeared, followed in 2008 by the Low Phat.</p>','<p>Year of release: 2013</p>','air-jordan-i-black-shadow-grey','Nike Air Jordan I Black/Shadow Grey AJ 1 OG retro 2013',NULL,'Air Jordan I Black/Shadow Grey','Air Jordan I Black/Shadow Grey',NULL,NULL),(935,1,2,'<p>Année de sortie: 2013</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>A propos de la Air Jordan I:</p>\r\n<p>Date de sortie du modèle original: 1985</p>\r\n<p>Designer: Peter Moore</p>\r\n<p>En 1985, pour sa première année en NBA, Michael Jordan a reçu le titre de Rookie de l’année et a participé à son premier All Star Game. La Air Jordan I a été la première basket multicolore à être portée en NBA, ce qui a entraîné son interdiction par la ligue. Si bien que, à chaque match où Jordan la portait, la NBA lui adressait une amende de plusieurs milliers de dollars. Nike a sauté sur cette occasion pour promouvoir la Air Jordan 1 et a décidé de payer les amendes infligées à MJ. Ainsi, la paire a été surnommée “la paire interdite en NBA“. La Air Jordan est sortie dans 23 coloris. <br />En 1994, Nike a réédité le modèle mais il n’a pas eu le succès commercial escompté. Depuis 2001, <br />la Air Jordan I est régulièrement rééditée dans différents coloris.

The air unit is now visible through a sidehole in the shoes. The famous JUMPMAN replaces the AIR JORDAN wings logo. A unique elephant print trim around the shoe.

It has been re-released as a retro version with an unmeasurable amount of colorways and themes. The Air Max 90 was referred to as the Air Max or the Air Max III until 2000, when it was reissued. It takes its current name from its launch year, 1990. The first colourway produced was the men’s white/ black/ cool grey/ red. It was striking to say the least: the radiant red around the visible Air window exaggerated the thickness of the midsole. The upper was made of Duromesh, synthetic suede and synthetic leather. The clean lines and dazzling colours made the Air Max a highly sought-after.</p>','<p>Year of release: 2014</p>','air-max-90-essential-triple-black','Nike Air Max 90 Essential \"Triple Black\" Black/Black 2014 Retro',NULL,'Air Max 90 Essential \"Triple Black\"','Air Max 90 Essential \"Triple Black\"',NULL,NULL),(1179,1,2,'<p>Année de sortie: 2014</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>A propos de la Air Max 90:</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Date de sortie du modèle original: 1990</p>\r\n<p>Designer: Tinker Hatfield</p>\r\n<p>Lancée en 1990 sous le nom Nike Air Max III, la Air Max 90 fait tourner les têtes avec une unité d’air encore plus visible et une plus grande stabilité et amorti. Ce modèle a été réédité dans une très grande variété de couleurs et de thèmes. La Air Max 90 a été dénommée Air Max ou Air Max III jusqu\'en 2000, quand elle a été rééditée. Son nom actuel vient de l’année de son lancement : 1990. Le colori de la première production pour homme est blanc/ noir/ gris/ rouge. Ce qui frappe sur ce modèle est le rouge rayonnant autour du système air  qui exagère l\'épaisseur de la semelle. La partie supérieure est faite en Duromesh, daim synthétique et cuir synthétique.

MJ is once again NBA finals MVP. <br />The Air Jordan VII was inspired by some African art festival poster that Tinker Hatfield (head designer) saw in Portland. A full-length Huarache inner bootie fits like a sock around the foot. The shoes are light. Minimal padding and support around the ankle. They are very comfortable to wear <br />but only suitable for point-guards and light forwards because of the lack of support.

Tinker Hatfield asked Michael Jordan what he would like in the Air Jordan VI. MJ said he\'d like it to be easy to get into, so Tinker designed 2 holes in the tongue and a \"spoiler\" heel tab in the back heel. The spoiler/heel tab was inspired by MJ\'s rare black slant-nosed or \"Flachbau\" Porsche 930 Turbo. The Air Jordan VI « Carmine », with its transparent sole, white leather and red carmine is considered by many collectors as one of the most beautiful pair of Air Jordan.</p>','<p>Year of release: 2015</p>','air-jordan-vi-low-black-silver-gs','Nike Air Jordan VI Low Black/Silver GS AJ 6 2015',NULL,'Air Jordan VI Low Black/Silver GS','Air Jordan VI Low Black/Silver GS',NULL,NULL),(1397,1,2,'<p>Année de sortie: 2015</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>A propos de la Air Jordan VI:</p>\r\n<p>Date de sortie du modèle original: 1990</p>\r\n<p>Designer: Tinker Hatfield</p>\r\n<p>En 1990-91, après 7 saisons en NBA, Michael Jordan mena Chicago à la victoire face aux Lakers (4 victoires à 1) pour le premier titre NBA de l’histoire du club. Tinker Hatfield demanda à Michael Jordan ce qu’il désirait pour la Air Jordan VI. Le souhait de MJ était de pouvoir enfiler la chaussure plus facilement. C’est pourquoi Tinker dessina pour cette chaussure une languette avec 2 trous et un « spoiler » au niveau supérieur du talon. Le spoiler a été inspiré par la Porsche 930 Turbo \"Flachbau\" de Michael Jordan. La Air Jordan VI Carmine, avec sa semelle transparente, son cuir blanc et rouge carmine est considérée par beaucoup de collectionneurs comme l’une des plus belles paires de Air Jordan.</p>','<p>Année de sortie: 2015</p>','air-jordan-vi-low-black-silver-gs','Nike Air Jordan VI Low Black/Silver GS AJ 6 2015',NULL,'Air Jordan VI Low Black/Silver GS','Air Jordan VI Low Black/Silver GS',NULL,NULL),(1397,1,3,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(1397,1,4,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(1397,1,5,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(1398,1,1,'<p>Year of release: 2015</p>','<p>Year of release: 2015</p>','flyknit-racer-blue-lagoon','Nike Air Flyknit Racer Blue Lagoon turquoise volt Technology 2014',NULL,'Flyknit Racer Blue Lagoon','Flyknit Racer \"Blue Lagoon\"',NULL,NULL),(1398,1,2,'<p>Année de sortie: 2015</p>','<p>Année de sortie: 2015</p>','flyknit-racer-blue-lagoon','Nike Air Flyknit Racer Blue Lagoon turquoise volt Technology 2014',NULL,'Flyknit Racer Blue Lagoon','Flyknit Racer \"Blue Lagoon\"',NULL,NULL),(1398,1,3,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(1398,1,4,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(1398,1,5,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(1400,1,1,'<p>Year of release: 2015</p>','<p>Year of release: 2015</p>','flyknit-racer-bright-crimson-volt','Nike Air Flyknit Racer Bright Crimson/Volt orange yellow volt Technology 2014',NULL,'Flyknit Racer Bright Crimson/Volt','Flyknit Racer Bright Crimson/Volt',NULL,NULL),(1400,1,2,'<p>Année de sortie: 2015</p>','<p>Année de sortie: 2015</p>','flyknit-racer-bright-crimson-volt','Nike Air Flyknit Racer Bright Crimson/Volt orange yellow volt Technology 2014',NULL,'Flyknit Racer Bright Crimson/Volt','Flyknit Racer Bright Crimson/Volt',NULL,NULL),(1400,1,3,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(1400,1,4,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(1400,1,5,NULL,NULL,'air-jordan-i-low-phat-black-red',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Air Jordan I Low Phat Black/Red',NULL,NULL),(1402,1,1,'<p>Year of release: 2014</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>About Air Tech Challenge II:</p>\r\n<p>Year of release of OG Model: 1990</p>\r\n<p>There has been a lot of anticipation and discussion around this Nike Collector shoe release.</p>\r\n<p>This Andre Agassi classic first hit the scene in 1990.

It has been re-released as a retro version with an unmeasurable amount of colorways and themes. The Air Max 90 was referred to as the Air Max or the Air Max III until 2000, when it was reissued. It takes its current name from its launch year, 1990. The first colourway produced was the men’s white/ black/ cool grey/ red. It was striking to say the least: the radiant red around the visible Air window exaggerated the thickness of the midsole. The upper was made of Duromesh, synthetic suede and synthetic leather.

Son nom actuel vient de l’année de son lancement : 1990. Le colori de la première production pour homme est blanc/ noir/ gris/ rouge. Ce qui frappe sur ce modèle est le rouge rayonnant autour du système air  qui exagère l\'épaisseur de la semelle. La partie supérieure est faite en Duromesh, daim synthétique et cuir synthétique.

This gave the Bull\'s an extra boost and everything was flying. Jordan kept on playing his game and set a personal best when scoring 69 points in a game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Once again Hatfield came up with a revolutionary design for the new shoe.</p>\r\n<p>The AJ5 was inspired by World War II Fighter planes (Spitfire WWII) brought to light by The \"reverse flames\". The clear outsole was inspired by the clear panels of Marty MacFly\'s Back to the Future II boots which Tinker had designed for the movie. Tinker put a reflective 3M tongue with Jumpman embroidery.

Tinker Hatfield puise cette fois son inspiration dans un avion de combat (le Spitfire WWII ), laissant apparaître des flammes inversées sur le côté de la chaussure. La semelle transparente a été inspirée par la paire de chaussure révolutionnaire (dessinée par Tinker hatfield) portée par Michael J Fox dans le film Retour vers le Futur II.

In 1994, Jordan had already retired from the NBA (following the murder of his father during summer ’93) and had decided to start a new career in baseball with the Chicago White Sox.  This explains the presence of the 10 lines of MJ’s main achievements on the sole of the shoe. After suffering a failure in baseball, MJ decides to make his come back in the NBA in march 1995. He’s back, wearing the AJX on court, with the Bulls but without his #23  (which had been retired). His come back is a success as he helps the Bulls qualify for the Playoffs.

En 1994, Jordan, retraité de la NBA à la suite de l’assassinat de son père, décida de tenter une carrière professionnelle dans le baseball en intégrant les Chicago White Sox. Ceci explique que la semelle du modèle porte, sur 10 lignes, le palmarès <br />de MJ. Après avoir essuyé un échec au baseball, il décide de revenir aux affaires en NBA en mars 1995. Il est donc de retour, avec les Bulls, Jordan X aux pieds, mais sans son numéro 23 (qui avait été retiré lors de sa retraite). Son retour est un succès, il aide les Bulls à se qualifier pour les <br />Playoffs.
